## üåü **What is Privacy Jenga?**

Privacy Jenga is an **interactive educational game** that teaches Bitcoin privacy and security concepts through engaging 3D tower mechanics. Each of the 54 blocks contains authentic Bitcoin privacy practices, making learning both fun and memorable.

### üß† **Educational Philosophy**
This implementation focuses on **continuous learning** and eliminates traditional "game over" mechanics. When the tower becomes unstable, it smoothly resets, allowing players to explore all 54 privacy concepts without interruption.
